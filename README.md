# Netmiko
Using Netmiko to securely (SSH) make changes to multiple devices

The following code was created as part of Network automation learning process. Netmiko is a versatile Python library with many benefits. 
I used it for the following scenarios:

1. Securely connect with multiple devices on the network (using SSH)
2. Read configuraiton from the file
3. Configure multiple devices
4. Apply different configuraiton for Distribution and Core switches
